Questions:
    
    QUESTION 2.1.1 - causing conflicts:
        A. Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?
        B. Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?
    ANSWER 2.1.1:
        Part A and B of this question have the same answer (explained below).
        In the case of small number of iterations, by the time the next thread is 
        created, the previous thread is done running all the required iterations. 
        As the number of iterations increase, the thread takes significantly 
        longer, so the next thread and current thread access the same memory
        location parallely for a short overlapping period of time. As we increase
        the number of threads and number of iterations, more threads overlap with
        each other for longer durations/more iterations of the for loop, resulting
        in a more skewed/incorrect value for the counter. 

    QUESTION 2.1.2 - cost of yielding:
        A. Why are the --yield runs so much slower?
        B. Where is the additional time going?
        C. Is it possible to get valid per-operation timings if we are using the --yield option?
        D. If so, explain how. If not, explain why not.
    ANSWER 2.1.2:
        As mentioned in the linux man page for sched_yield(),
