    lab4b.c:
        This program contains code that logs temperature values from an analog 
        temperature sensor on the Beaglebone Green Wireless embedded system, and 
        can process commands passed in through a pipe. It also has a GPIO button
        that can stop execution of the program. Additionally, a user can enable/disable 
        logging features and change the scale of temperature readings to farhenheit or
        celcius.

    README:
        This file contains a description of all the files enclosed in the compressed
        tarball.

    Makefile:
        Makefile supports 4 different targets - default, clean, dist and check. Default 
        builds the executable, clean removes all compressed tarballs and the executable,
        dist creates the required compressed tarball with all of the files mentioned in
        the README, and check runs smoke tests executes an automated smoke-test of the 
        executable to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors.

    tests.sh:
        Contains a set of smoke tests to ensure the executable works correctly, understands
        run-time stdin inputs, logs to files correctly, updates periods correctly.
