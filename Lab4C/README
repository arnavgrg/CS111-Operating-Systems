    README:
        This contains a description of all the files in the compressed Tarball.

    Makefile:
        The makefile contains three targets default, dist and clean. It helps compile 
        lab4c_tcp.c and lab4c_tls.c, as well as build a compressed tarball containing 
        the four files described in the README. The clean target removes all compressed
        tarballs and executables.

    lab4c_tcp.c:
        This C file builds on lab 4b's temperature polling and command processing to connect 
        to and receive commands from a tcp server. A port number and hostname should be specified 
        to connect to it. The program also takes a 9 digit id which it immediately reports to 
        the server. The temperature logs are sent to the server, while it receives commands sent 
        by the server. The server directly controls execution of the beaglebone, and eventually 
        issues the OFFF command to stop execution of the program.

    lab4c_tls.c:
        This C file builds on lab 4C's TCP implementation, but instead of using a TCP connection,
        it uses a TLS connection. The only difference is that it uses the SSL library instead. The
        communication to and from the server remainds the same as described in lab4c_tcp.c
