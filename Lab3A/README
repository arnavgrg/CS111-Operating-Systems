Files:
  1. README 
     The README contains a description of all the files in the zipped tarball.
     In particular, it describes the contents of the Makefile and any C/C++ 
     header and source files.
     
  2. Makefile
     The Makefile has 3 targets - default, dist and clean. The default target 
     compiles the C source files to create an executable calld lab3a. It
     compiles these files with a the -Wall and -Wextra options. Make dist 
     creates the required compressed tarball file called lab3a-304911796.tar.gz.
     The clean target removes all object and executable files, as well as any
     compressed tarball files.
     
  3. lab3a.c
     This file contains all the required code for this project. This file 
     explores an EXT2 file system. It takes one argument - the name of the image
     as input and returns an analysis on the contents in the image's super block,
     block group descriptor table, free blocks and inodes per group, used inodes
     per group, directories and indirect block references. This is done through
     a bunch of functions and helper functions, where most of the work in done 
     outside of main.
  
  4. ext2_fs.h
     A slightly simplified version of the Linux header file that defines the format 
     of the EXT2 file system.
